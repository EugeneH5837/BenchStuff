# Example Application
See folders StudentManager and tomcat

add in setenv.bat to 
set JAVA_OPTS= -Xmx64M -Xms64M

sets up web server that connects to db 

Then use VisualVM to monitor the application. There are typically not memory leaks in tomcat so most likely there is an issue in the code.

Then use jMeter in order to test load the application.

Mostly just testing with Java VisualVM, jMeter, etc.
