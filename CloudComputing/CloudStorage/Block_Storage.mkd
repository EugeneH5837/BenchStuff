Type of storage really depends on the use case

Cloud block storage like AWS Elastic Block Store provides a virtualized storage area network with logical
volume management provisioning via a simplified web services interface.
Once instances of storage are launched, storage can be added/removed.

Use Cases:
- Databases
- Email Services
- RAID
- VMs
